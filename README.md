# Conference Management Portal
 This is our Design Credit project for this semester.

## Installation using docker(recommended)

1. Clone the repo `$ git clone https://github.com/laur1s/PHP-Registration-Form.git`
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` This will fetch PHP and MySQL Docker images, launch apache on http://localhost:8080 and MySQL on port 3306
3. If you want to stop the service just run `docker-compose down`
 
# Here are the deliverables we are targeting to complete:
 
1. Login based access to the portal.
2. Users who would be presenting a paper at the conference can upload PDF files, jpg files and video files.
3. Other users who are attending the conference will be able to visit the pages corresponding to each paper and view the uploaded files.
4. There will be an admin login who can give privileges to various users (for example, if and what kind of files they are allowed to upload).
